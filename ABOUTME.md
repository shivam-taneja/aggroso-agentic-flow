## Summary
I am a Full Stack Developer currently working at **NTT Data**, where I modernize cloud platforms for global affiliates. With a strong foundation in the **MERN stack** and a passion for **AI Engineering**, I actively build SaaS tools that bridge the gap between complex code and user-friendly interfaces.

I have built multiple AI-powered products, such as **DecodeMyCode** (an AI code explainer) and **EZNotify** (a multi-channel notification SDK). I love solving problems where reliability and scale are just as important as the feature set itself.
